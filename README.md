# GCP compliance tests with Inspec.
Tests that I really wish were in their samples, but aren't.
## TODO:
- No default [open firewall rules](https://github.com/inspec/inspec-gcp/blob/master/docs/resources/google_compute_firewall.md)
- No public [bucket objects](https://github.com/inspec/inspec-gcp/blob/master/docs/resources/google_storage_object_acl.md)
- No BQ [table view](https://github.com/inspec/inspec-gcp/blob/master/docs/resources/google_bigquery_table.md)
- No [service account keys](https://github.com/inspec/inspec-gcp/blob/master/docs/resources/google_service_account_key.md) for default app service accounts
